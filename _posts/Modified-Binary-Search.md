> 无处不在的二分思想。往往通过外部变量 track 中间结果，元素不是 distinct 时需要单独处理。有时仅为解法的一小步，bisect_left 第一个大于等于；bisect_right 第一个大于。

As we know, whenever we are given **a sorted array or linked list or matrix**, and we are asked to find a certain element, the best algorithm we can use is binary search.

This pattern describes an efficient way to handle all problems involving _Binary Search_. We will go through a set of problems that will help us build an understanding of this pattern so that we can apply this technique to other problems we might come across in the interviews.

## Snippets
```python
lo, hi = 0, len(nums) - 1
while lo <= hi:
    mid = lo + ((hi - lo) >> 1)
    if nums[mid] >= target:
        if mid == 0 or nums[mid-1] < target:  # find leftmost element
            return mid
        
        hi = mid - 1
    else:
        lo = mid + 1

return len(nums)  # all less
```
