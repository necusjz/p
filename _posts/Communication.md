Questions about communication are asked to evaluate your ability to work effectively with others and articulate technical ideas clearly. In a software development environment, communication plays a critical role in ensuring project success. As such, interviewers want to assess your communication skills to determine if you can collaborate effectively with team members, stakeholders, and clients.

When answering questions about communication, it is important to provide specific examples of how you have communicated technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, how you have provided constructive feedback to team members, and how you have adapted your communication style to suit different audiences. You should also demonstrate your ability to actively listen and be open to feedback. By providing specific examples and emphasizing your strong communication skills, you can increase your chances of impressing the interviewer and securing the job you are applying for.
