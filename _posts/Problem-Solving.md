Problem solving is a critical skill for any software engineer, and it’s not just about finding a solution to a technical challenge. It’s also about identifying the right problem to solve, breaking it down into manageable pieces, and communicating your approach and progress to others. That’s why many job interviews for software engineering positions include questions about problem solving.

When answering questions about problem solving in a behavioral job interview, it’s important to focus on your process, not just your end result. Explain how you approached the problem, the steps you took to analyze and break it down, and any roadblocks you encountered along the way. Be sure to emphasize your communication skills, both with technical and nontechnical stakeholders, as collaboration is a crucial aspect of problem solving in the workplace. Finally, highlight any lessons you learned from the experience and how you would approach similar problems in the future.
