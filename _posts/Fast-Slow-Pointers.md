The _Fast & Slow Pointers_ approach is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or linked list) at different speeds. This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic linked lists or arrays.

By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic linked list), the algorithm proves that **the two pointers are bound to meet**. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.

## Snippets
```python
l = r = head
while r and r.next:
    l = l.next
    r = r.next.next
    if l == r:
        break
else:
    return

l = head
while l != r:
    l = l.next
    r = r.next

return l
```
