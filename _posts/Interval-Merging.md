## Statement
Given a set of numbers find an optimal solution for a problem considering the current number and the best you can get from the left and right sides.

## Approach
Find all optimal solutions for every interval and return the best possible answer:
> dp\[i]\[j] = dp\[i]\[k] + result\[k] + dp\[k+1]\[j]

Get the best from the left and right sides and add a solution for the current position:
```cpp
for (int l = 1; l < n; ++l) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n - l + 1; ++i) {
        int j = i + l - 1;
        for (int k = i; k < j; ++k) {
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + result[k] + dp[k+1][j]);
        }
    }
}
return dp[0][n-1];
```
