## Statement
Given two strings **s1** and **s2**, return a result.

## Approach
Most of the problems on this pattern requires a solution that can be accepted in O(n^2) complexity:
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
        if (s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]) {
            dp[i][j] = /* code */;
        } else {
            dp[i][j] = /* code */;
        }
    }
}
```

If you are given one string **s** the approach may little vary:
```cpp
for (int l = 1; l < n; ++l) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n - l + 1; ++i) {
        int j = i + l - 1;
        if (s[i] == s[j]) {
            dp[i][j] = /* code */;
        } else {
            dp[i][j] = /* code */;
        }
    }
}
```
