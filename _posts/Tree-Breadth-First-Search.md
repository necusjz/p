This pattern is based on the _Breadth-First Search_ (BFS) technique to traverse a tree.

Any problem involving the traversal of a tree in a level-by-level order can be efficiently solved using this approach. We will use a **queue** to keep track of all the nodes of a level before we jump onto the next level. This also means that the space complexity of the algorithm will be O(W), where "W" is **the maximum number of nodes on any level**.

## Snippets
```python
if not root:
    return

queue = deque([root])
while queue:
    curr_len = len(queue)
    for idx in range(curr_len):
        node = queue.popleft()
        if idx != curr_len - 1:
            node.next = queue[0]

        # bfs
        if node.left:
            queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)

return root
```
