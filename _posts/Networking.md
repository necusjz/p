## Starting a conversation
> Where do you come from then?

### Useful Tips
- Successful small talk is not about saying brilliant things. It's about commenting on and asking about **ordinary things** with conviction, interest, and enthusiasm.
- **Match the mood** of your conversation partner. If they are smiling and cheerful, be ready to laugh. If they seem serious, be serious too.
- Ask where your partner comes from and, when somebody asks you the same thing, be ready to add **something interesting** about the place.
- Ask what your partner does and, when you're asked the same question, **don't only give a title.** Add a small piece of interesting or amusing information about the job or responsibility.

### Track 01
**1**
A: That was really interesting what the last speaker said about opening bank accounts in the Cayman Islands.
B: Yes, it was. **So, what do you do exactly?**
A: **I'm an auditor, a forensic auditor.**
B: Ah, um, you're a forensic, um, auditor?
A: Yes, that's right.
B: Right, oh. I see. Look at the time! I must get to the next presentation...

**2**
C: Mmm, lovely coffee! I needed that. I just flew in from London very early this morning. **How did you get here?**
D: I came on the TGV train from Paris.
C: Really? I've never been on the TGV. **How long did that take?**
D: Oh, about 4 hours. But I was able to have breakfast and do some reading.
C: That sounds nice. I must try it sometime. **Marseilles's really beautiful, isn't it?**
D: Yes, it is. **Have you been here before?** If you haven't, you must...

**3**
E: ...I'm certainly looking forward to the dinner this evening.
F: I am too. Especially the fish. We don't have much fish where I live.
E: Really? **Where do you come from then?**
F: Garmisch-Partenkirchen. It's in the mountains just near Munich. What about you?
E: I'm from Cork in Ireland. The high street is supposed to have more pubs than any other town in Ireland.
F: Really? I'm going there on a business trip soon to visit the Apple factory. I must see if I can find time to visit some...

**4**
G: ...and then I went jogging early this morning along by the sea. Fantastic sunrise coming up over the sea.
H: Really? Sunrise, you say?
G: Yes, amazing! Do you like jogging? You should try it, you know. It makes you feel really great all day long. Just set the alarm for 5:30, jump out of bed and after you've been running for about an hour or so, go back, have a shower and...
H: **Sorry, but do you know where I can smoke?** I think I want a cigarette before the next presentation. Ah, that way? Thanks.

## Talking about jobs
> It's a very challenging profession.

### Useful Tips
When telling people about your job:
- **Be brief** and precise.
- Show how your job **benefits people** or organizations.
- Make sure that your description is **relevant to the person** you are talking to.
- **Avoid technical terms** or abbreviations unless talking to a fellow expert.
- **Accentuate the positive aspects** rather than the negative.

### Track 07
Student: Excuse me, are you working on the Foodaid stand?
Jenny: Yes, can I help you?
S: Well, can you tell me what jobs at Foodaid involve?
J: There are lots of jobs at Foodaid which **involve doing** all sorts of different things. What subject do you study at university?
S: Engineering
J: Very important for Foodaid. My colleague, Hassan Sahin, for example, is a mechanical engineer and **he is responsible for helping** farmers in countries such as Chad or Pakistan where we work as an NGO to drill water wells.
S: Er... an NGO?
J: Sorry, a Non-Governmental Organization.
S: Right, of course. And what do you do?
J: Well, actually **I'm a lawyer. I'm in charge of managing** the legal department and we make sure that Foodaid understands any legal issues that might crop up in the work it does.
S: I hope I don't sound rude, but you look very young to do that.
J: That's what's so good about Foodaid! You get important responsibilities very quickly. A friend of mine is working in Somalia and **she manages** a development budget of about 2 million dollars and **she supplies** the whole of West Africa with trucks for transporting food and equipment. **It's a very challenging job** and she's only 23!
S: I see. But, as it's a charity, do you get paid for your work?
J: Yes, of course. You'll never be rich working for Foodaid, but you get paid. Very often people like you work with us for a few years to gain experience and then they move on to other jobs. Lots of companies like the fact that you've worked for a charity.
S: Hmm. So, what makes a job with Foodaid interesting, then?
J: **It's very rewarding.** You feel you are doing something useful with your skills, not just making some company shareholders rich. And even if **the work is demanding**, it's never boring.
S: It sounds really interesting. Thanks for telling me about it.
J: That's fine. Here's some more information about what we do and my card. If you have any more questions, just give me a ring...

## Showing interest in other people
> Oh, I know what you mean.

### Useful Tips
When you are in conversation:
- **Echo the key information** to encourage further explanation, for example, _I'm allergic to shellfish. To shellfish?_
- Empathize. Use phrases to show that you **understand how your partner feels**, for example, _That's amazing!_ or _Really?_
- Paraphrase. **Reformulate in your own words** what has been said to show that you are listening, for example, _So what you're telling me is..._

### Track 10
Casper: It's very different way to do business here in Singapore, compared to Germany.
Emily: **I know what you mean.** Do you find it difficult?
C: No, not at all. It's interesting.
E: Interesting?
C: Yes. For example, in Singapore you discuss prices much earlier in a negotiation than we do in Germany.
E: **Really? So, you mean that** you leave price negotiations till the end of a discussion?
C: Oh, yes. In Singapore you start talking about prices for products when in Germany we're still trying to define exactly what's wanted.
E: **How amazing!** I didn't realize. I suppose we think it's a waste of time discussing something if the price is always going to be unrealistic.
C: **I see.**
E: Whereas in Germany you feel you can't begin to think about price until you know all the details.
C: **That's right.**
E: So, do you like Singapore?
C: Oh, yes. Very much, especially the food. But I need to do some sport. I've put on 2 kilos already! Back in Berlin I play centre forward for the company football team.
E: **Really?**
C: Yes, um... anyway, um...
E: Do you notice any other differences between business life here and in Germany?
C: Well, another difference is the flexibility that a manager has here.
D: Flexibility?
C: Yes. In Germany it's very difficult to be a manager because every time you want to introduce a change in the organization or in communication processes, you have to ask the Workers' Council for permission. This makes innovation very slow, which isn't good for the employees at all.
E: **So, what you're saying is** that the Workers' Council in Germany makes things more difficult for employees, not easier.
C: Sometimes, yes.
E: **That's terrible!**

## Exchanging information
> I heard it on the grapevine.

### Useful Tips
Here are 3 ways to get the information you want within your organization:
- **First offer appropriate information** yourself. If you want to find out about a particular area, offer information of your own first to show you can be trusted. Think carefully about what information is appropriate to pass on to others.
- **Ask questions indirectly.** If you want to ask about somebody or something, use statements with question tags rather than direct questions, for example, _You know John, don't you?_ rather than _Do you know John?_ A direct question may frighten someone into remaining silent but a statement that sounds more like speculation will often be confirmed or corrected by somebody with better information.
- **Create intimacy.** If you don't know somebody very well, but want to exchange information with that person, you can use these techniques: Drop their name into conversation more than usual and use _we, us_ and _our_ as often as possible, for example, _I think we're going to see a lot of changes in our department soon, Peter._

### Track 18
Candy: I really want to thank you, Michael, for taking me with you to the meeting. I just can't get used to driving on the left!
Michael: No problem.
C: You used to work for our new chief legal officer, Christine Bender, didn't you?
M: Yes, that's right. She and I started together in the legal department 5 years ago. Then I changed over to IT.
C: Christine is so successful. She did an amazing job for us dealing with that whole corruption scandal last year, don't you think?
M: Yes, she did. But, **between you and me,** Christine could never have managed that without her team.
C: That's so true, Michael. She always picks good people to work with her. By the way, **I heard on the grapevine** that she's going to move to our New York office next.
M: Yes, I heard that too. **I wonder how** her husband feels about it. He's journalist, I think.
C: Well, **according to** Christine's assistant, Mrs Weber, that's not a problem. He's going to write articles about New York nightlife. Although **I can't imagine** who's going to look after the children then.
M: **Apparently,** they're going to have a nanny. **I overheard** Christine talking to the boss about it this morning. It must be very expensive, but they'll have enough money.
C: **I suppose** they might appoint somebody from Christine's team to carry on her work.
M: Ah, no! **It seems that** Christine didn't want to recommend any of them to the boss, so Gabriele from the commercial department will take over. Christine's team was really angry!
