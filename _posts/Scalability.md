## Vertical Scaling
Get more RAM, processors, disks for one machine, but you will exhaust the financial resources/state.

## Horizontal Scaling
Plural number of machines, use multiple servers to build the topology.

## Cache
### .html
Requires a lot of work when want to update/redesign the page.
### MySQL Query Cache
query_cache_type = 1
### Memcached
Store whatever you want in RAM.
**G**arbage **C**ollection: expire objects based on when they are put in.
## Load Balancing

### Implementation
- Dedicated servers for images, videos... for different host **HTTP header**.
- **Round Robin**. The load balancer can be a DNS setup which returns the IP address of server 1 when the first time someone asks for a URL, then return the IP address of server 2 when the second time someone asks for the same url, then server 3, server 4... eventually wrapping up.
    - Downside: one server may get a really computational heavy user.
- Based on the load on a server.
- Have a server specifically for storing sessions. But what if that machine breaks down. Lacks redundancy, can add RAID (**R**edundant **A**rray of **I**ndependent **D**isks).

### Load Balancers

## Replication
### Master-Slave
**Master**: the main database that you write/read data to/from.
**Slave**: anytime a query is executed on the master that same query is copied down to one or more slaves and they do the exact same thing.

#### Advantage
- If the **master is down**, promote one of the slaves and do some configuration. (redundancy)
- If there are a lot queries, you could just **load balance across** database servers.
- For read heavy websites, any `select` can go to all four databases, while any `insert/update/delete` has to go to server master.

### Master-Master
You could write to either server one or two and if you happen to write to server 1 that query gets replicated on server 2 and **vice versa**, so now you could keep it simple.

### Load Balancing + Replication
`active + passive pair` of load balancers, passive promote itself when receives no more packets from the active one, and send packets to each other.

## Partitioning
A-M cluster and N-Z cluster:

### High Availability
One load balancer, two master replicating each other:
