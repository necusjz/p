## Statement
Given a target find a number of distinct ways to reach the target.

## Approach
Sum all possible ways to reach the current state:
> dp\[i] = dp\[i-1] + dp\[i-2] + ... + dp\[i-k]

Generate sum for all values in the target and return the value for the target:
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < ways.size(); ++j) {
        if (ways[j] <= i) {
            dp[i] += dp[i-ways[j]];
        }
    }
}
return dp[target];
```

**Note**:
Some questions point out the number of repetitions, in that case, **add one more loop** to simulate every repetition.
