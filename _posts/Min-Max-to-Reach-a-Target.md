## Statement
Given a target find minimum (maximum) cost/path/sum to reach the target.

## Approach
Choose minimum (maximum) path among all possible paths before the current state, then add value for the current state:
> dp\[i] = min(dp\[i-1], dp\[i-2], ..., dp\[i-k]) + cost\[i]

Generate optimal solutions for all values in the target and return the value for the target:
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < ways.size(); ++j) {
        if (ways[j] <= i) {
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-ways[j]] + cost);
        }
    }
}
return dp[target];
```
