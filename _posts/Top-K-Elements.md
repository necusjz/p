> heapq 的大型应用现场，常与 freq 配合使用。借助 index 可以实现对复杂 object 的比较，也可以通过 total_ordering 定义数据类。有时需要用队列暂存 heappop 的元素。

Any problem that asks us to find the _Top K Elements_ among a given set falls under this pattern.

The best data structure that comes to mind to keep track of "K" elements is **heap**. This pattern will make use of the heap to solve multiple problems dealing with "K" elements at a time from a set of given elements.

## Snippets
```python
freq = dict()
for char in s:
    freq[char] = freq.get(char, 0) + 1

max_heap = []
for char in freq:
    heappush(max_heap, (-freq[char], char))

ans = ""
while max_heap:
    queue, k = [], 2  # store pop-up items
    while max_heap and k > 0:
        count, char = heappop(max_heap)
        ans += char

        if -count - 1 > 0:
            queue.append((count + 1, char))
        
        k -= 1
    
    if k > 0 and queue:
        return ""
    
    for item in queue:
        heappush(max_heap, item)  # push back

return ans
```
